# 🐍 Python Basics
A growing collection of Python functions, mini-projects, and notes as I master the fundamentals.
## 📂 Structure
- **functions/** — reusable Python functions grouped by topic  
- **mini_projects/** — small practice scripts using those functions  
- **notes/** — my personal explanations and summaries of Python concepts
## 💡 Goal
To build a clean, beginner-friendly Python reference library while learning step by step.
